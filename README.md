# Procedural Jellyfish

A procedural, animated moon-jellyfish built in Houdini: a pulsing translucent bell with branching veins, four pink gonad rings inside, ruffled oral arms simulated as Vellum cloth, and long tentacles simulated as Vellum hair.

## Breakdown

### Bell
- A **Line** is shaped with two **Bend** nodes (`bend_tip`, `bend_main`), centered with **Match Size**, and spun into a dome with **Revolve**.
- **Fuse** welds the seam, **Attribute Noise** adds subtle lumps, and **Poly Extrude** gives the shell thickness.
- A `Controller` null drives the pulse: its keyframed channels animate the bend angles and the bell's vertical translation in `transform1`.

### Oral Arms
- A **Grid** gets ruffled edges from an **Attribute Wrangle** (`add_ruffle`: a sine wave in z whose amplitude grows toward the edges, plus noise), then is twisted, remeshed, and copied into several arms.
- The arms are attached to the bell with **Point Deform**, then simulated as **Vellum cloth** with their top points pinned to the animation, and cached with **File Cache**.
- A **Normal** node gives the simulated mesh smooth shading.

### Veins
Following the assignment workflow:
1. **Remesh** the rest-pose bell into triangles so the paths are not grid-aligned.
2. An Attribute Wrangle picks 12 root points near the top and 60 tip points spread down the bell; **Find Shortest Path** connects them, with a noise-based cost for more organic branching.
3. Overlapping paths are welded and de-duplicated (**Fuse → Convert Line → Wrangle → PolyPath**), and each branch is made thicker where more paths share it.
4. **Resample → Fuse → Smooth** rounds out the paths while keeping the junctions fixed.
5. The curves are projected back onto the bell surface and given width with **Sweep**.
6. **Point Deform** (rest bell → animated bell) makes the veins follow the pulse.

### Organs
- A **Torus** is squashed into an oval, offset from the center, given organic lumps with **Attribute Noise**, and copied four times around the bell axis with **Copy and Transform**.
- The rings are placed just under the inside of the dome and follow the bell with **Point Deform**.

### Tentacles
Adapted from the Vellum hair tutorial, with the jellyfish's rim in place of a scalp:
1. The bell's rim is found with **Group Create** (unshared edges); every third rim point becomes a root, tucked slightly inside the rim and given a random length.
2. A downward **Line** is copied onto each root, and the first two points of each curve go into a `root` group.
3. The curves move with the bell's roots (roots follow the bell via **Point Deform**).
4. **Vellum Hair** constraints pin the `root` group with *Match Animation*. Low bend stiffness, low gravity, and velocity damping keep the motion soft and underwater-like. The result is cached with **File Cache**.
5. **Sweep** turns the curves into tubes that taper from root to tip.

### Look and Playback
- Each part gets its own color (`Cd`) and viewport transparency (`Alpha`): a translucent blue bell, milky-white arms, pink organs, and pale tentacles. The bell is merged last so the parts inside it stay visible.
- Everything is merged, stripped down to the attributes the viewport needs, and cached once more (`final_cache`) so the viewport plays back in real time.
